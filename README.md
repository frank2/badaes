This is my repository for learning AES, so it is bad and you should not use it.
# If you use this library, whatever you do, please do NOT use the base-class AESCipher, or its more explicit definition, AESCipherECB, unless you REALLY WANT THAT ONE SPECIFICALLY. This mode of blockcipher encryption is weak as all fuck. Use AESCipherCBC or one of the other modes.
